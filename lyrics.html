                Soso take my pain away
        Soso take my pain
        Soso take my pain away
        Soso take my pain (pain, pain, pain)
        Soso take my pain away (take my pain)
        Soso take my pain away (please, come take my pain away)
        Soso take my pain away
        Soso take my pain (mad)

        Ahn, ahn
        All of the things them talk, I no dey hear, hear
        Try wetin I do if you no dey fear, fear
        One mind dey tell me to disappear, 'pear
        Soso come and help me oh 'cause I don pray
        Maami, I don break commandment
        I can't stay for one place

        For God sake, oh my dear
        Come take my pain away from me, oh
        Soso take my pain away (take-take, take, take-take)
        Soso take my pain (soso, please, come take my pains away)
        Soso take my pain away (soso, soso, soso)
        Soso take my pain
        Shibiri, shibiri, shibiri, uh
        They are talkin' shi-shibiri
        Water no get enemy
        'Til you fall for Oshimiri

        I poto poto my eyes
        Ten shots
        High rise
        Touch God
        I cry
        Offshore
        Cut my dreadlocks
        Girlie, me, I don pray
        Maami, I don break commandment
        I can't stay for one place
        For God sake, oh my dear
        Come and ginger me

        Only you dey feel my pains
        Give me vitamins wey go take these pains away
        Soso oh, soso, soso, oh
        Soso take my pain away (take-take, take, take-take)
        Soso take my pain (soso, please, come take my pains away)
        Soso take my pain away (so, so, so-so)
        Soso take my pain away (take my pain)
        Soso take my pain away (take my pain away)
        Soso take my pain
        Soso take my pain away

        Soso take my pain
